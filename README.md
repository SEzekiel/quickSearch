# quickSearch
Quick search is a simple java software I created in leisure time.
The whole idea is to simplify web search by typing a search term directly into a textbox
and get the results loaded into your default web browser.
The aim is to eliminate the time it takes to launch your browser, open google, for example, then type your
saerch term and wait for results.
The application windows is always on top of all other open windows so that you can quickly type a term.
In addition to sending terms for results, you can also search for the meaning of a word simply by clicking the 
required button.
The app was develop using the netbeans IDE, feel free to contribute, download and modify the files as you wish.
